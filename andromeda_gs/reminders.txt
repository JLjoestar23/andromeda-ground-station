To have an image show up in the python script after converting it from a .ui to
a .py, you must have the following:

```
import os

self.image_path = os.path.join(
            os.path.dirname(__file__), "images", "logo_resized.png"
        )
self.logo.setPixmap(QtGui.QPixmap(self.image_path))
```

There is a weird thing when setting QLabels as images through directory 
location, where even though in the converted .py file the pixmap is set as:

```
self.logo.setPixmap(QtGui.QPixmap("images\image_name.png")
```

the image is not displayed when running the python script.

Reason is unknown exactly, probably something to do with not recognizing the
filepath, but its not a big deal with an easy work around.
